                <p>
                    In creative arts, students discover a variety of art forms through a study of dance, drama, music and 
                    visual arts. <br><br>
                    Studying the creative arts, students learn to appreciate, compose, listen, make and perform. Each art form 
                    has its own unique knowledge and skills, elements or concepts as well as a capacity to inspire and enrich 
                    lives. <br><br>
                    Students must study 100 hours of both music and visual arts during Years 7 to 10. They also have an 
                    opportunity to further develop their knowledge and skills in other art forms through elective subjects 
                    including drama, dance, photography and visual design. Students can then select from a range of courses in 
                    Years 11 to 12.

                <p>
                    English study is mandatory in NSW from Kindergarten to Year 12. <br><br>
                    In English, students learn about the study and use of the English language in its various textual forms. 
                    These encompass spoken, written and visual texts through which meaning is shaped, conveyed, interpreted and 
                    reflected. Complexity increases as students progress through their schooling. <br><br>
                    Developing proficiency in English enables students to take their place as confident communicators; critical 
                    and imaginative thinkers; lifelong learners; and informed, active participants in Australian society. Their 
                    understanding of English through knowledge and skills acquisition is essential to their intellectual, social 
                    and emotional development. <br><br>
                    The study of English should develop a love of literature and learning and be challenging and enjoyable. It 
                    develops skills to enable students to experiment with ideas and expression, to become active, independent 
                    and lifelong learners, to work with each other and to reflect on their learning. <br><br>
                    In Year 11 and 12, the study of English is mandatory. Courses offered include: <br><br>
                    English Extension 2; English Extension 1; English Advanced; English Standard; English Studies; English as 
                    an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D); English Life Skills.

                    In human society and its environment (HSIE), both subjects of history and geography are mandatory from 
                    Kindergarten to Year 10. <br><br>
                    Students learn specific historical and geographical concepts and skills in history and geography. They also 
                    have an opportunity to learn more about people and the societies and environments in which they live 
                    through elective subjects in Years 7 to 10 (Stages 4 to 5). <br><br>
                    A large number of individual subjects make up the key learning area of HSIE in which students:
                    <ul class="subject">
                        <li>research, gather and analyse information</li>

                        <li>write for a variety of purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    In Year 11 and 12, students can choose from a range of HSIE courses. These include: <br><br>

                <p>
                    In NSW high schools, languages is a key learning area. <br><br>
                    Language study allows students to develop communication skills, learn about languages as systems and 
                    explore the relationship between language and culture. Students engage with the linguistic and cultural 
                    diversity of societies and reflect on their understanding of social interactions. <br><br>
                    The study of a language is compulsory for 100 hours in one continuous school year from Year 7 to Year 10, 
                    but preferably in Years 7 or 8. <br><br>
                    In Years 11 and 12, NSW schools offer a wide variety of languages, catering for beginning students to 
                    background speakers.

                    The study of mathematics is mandatory from Kindergarten to Year 10. <br><br>
                    By studying mathematics, students learn to work mathematically developing fluency, understanding, 
                    problem-solving, reasoning and communication skills. <br><br>
                    The syllabus consists of the following strands:

                    and wellbeing of themselves and others – now and in the future. Students also participate in challenging and

                    Life Ready is a mandatory 25 hour program for students in Years 11 and/or 12 in NSW public schools. <br><br>
                    It aims to prepare and support senior students as they encounter situations related to health and safety as 
                    they become more independent and gain more responsibilities. <br><br>
                    Life Ready focuses on offering opportunities for students to build the functional knowledge and skills for 
                    life after school.
